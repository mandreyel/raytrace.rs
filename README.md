Toy ray tracer study, written in Rust, based on Peter Schirley's [Ractring in One Weekend](https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html). It's a good book, but it doesn't explain everything in detail, so for those without a formal education in computer graphics some parts may be difficult to understand, so I recommend heavy Wikipedia binging alongside the primary material to better grasp the underlying concepts.
