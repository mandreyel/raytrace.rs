# raytrace.rs

Toy ray tracer study, written in Rust, based on Peter Schirley's [Ray Tracing in
One
Weekend](https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html).
It's a good book, but (due to its brevity) it doesn't explain the underlying
concepts in detail, so for those without a formal education in computer
graphics, like me, some parts may be difficult to understand at first, so I
recommend heavy Wikipedia binging alongside the primary material to better grasp
the theory (and not just code along!).
